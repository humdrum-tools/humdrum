##					YANK2.AWK
# Programmed by: Tim Racinsky        Date: July, 1993
# Copyright (c) 1993 David Huron
#
# Modifications:
#   Date:      Programmer:       	Description:
# May 9/94	Tim Racinsky		Removed 'Not found' error statement so that
#							'silence is golden' rule was maintained
# June 7/94	Tim Racinsky		Modified parse_command for getopts
#
#
#	This program implements the 'm' option or, the 'marker' option,
# of the yank program. It is called from the program yank.ksh.
# It allows the user to specify a 'marker' and a range of numbers which
# represent line numbers appearing after each occurrence of 'marker' int
# the input.  As with all yank programs, comments and interpretations 
# within the yanked material are output as well as all interpretations 
# before the yanked material.
#
# Main Functions used:
#	Parse_command()			Determine_range()
#	Parse_dollar_range()		Separate_number_range()
#	Terminate()				Process_match()
#	Determine_number_of_fields()	Store_indicators()
#	Process_indicators()
#
# Helper Functions used:
#	Print_records_to_cut()
#
# The program find_reg.awk is also used to assist in finding all occurrences
# of the specified regular expression before any records are processed.
#
#	VARIABLES:
#
#  -ANACRUSIS:  flags whether or not we have come upon the first record that
#   matches the regular expression (TRUE means we have not).
#  -FINAL:  does the same job for the material after the last record that
#   matches the regular expression.
#  -FIRST_RECORD_PRINTED_YET:  differs from ANACRUSIS in that it marks the
#   the first record that is printed (as opposed to the first matched record).
#  -last_number:  keeps track of the last record to print out in the FINAL
#   segment.
#  -data_count:  keeps track of how many data records have been parsed for
#   the current segment.
#  -occurrence:  keeps track of how many records have been found that contained
#   the regular expression.
#  -number_of_fields: keeps track of how many fields are currently active so
#   that the proper number of spine-path terminators may be printed at the
#   conclusion of the yanked material.
#  -current_file:  holds the name of the current input file
#
#	ARRAYS:
#
#  -number_of_lines:  each successive element holds the number of data
#   records that occur between successive records that match the reg. exp.
#  -records_to_cut:  subscripts represent the records that
#   are to be cut from the current segment.  This array has to be 
#   recalculated for each different segment.
